The design was made on the basis of inspiration with the urban landscape. It differs from hangers with this motif in that usually the city is presented in a flat form. We decided to design a hanger model resembling buildings in 3D form. This makes the hanger look like a simplified model of skyscrapers placed on a glass platform. This platform is designed to fulfill the role of a shelf for shoes, which is an additional advantage of the design. Thanks to this, our hanger performs two functions at the same time. For visualization, we decided to use the 3D INVENTOR computer program.</p>

The main assumption of the project was to get rid of the surface
creating a door handle to leave the edges alone.
In addition, these edges were to build an inspired door handle
geometric products. The design was intended to be
printed in a 3D printer.
For visualization I decided to use a computer program
INVENTOR Professional. The project is presented on renderings in
steel color. Creation of an openwork door handle, without large surfaces

regarding the psychology of food and the shape of the main course
pizza divided into triangles. Bright colors were used
stimulating the desire to eat, then they were complemented by bright,
soft colors and wood so that the viewer does not strain the eye.
In addition, the shape of the chairs and sofa reminds pizza without
one piece. We decided to use it for visualization
